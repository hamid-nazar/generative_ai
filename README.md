# SaaS Platform Powered By Generative AI
* I will develop, as part of my mandatory machine learning course assignment, a SaaS AI Platform based on the requirements and description below.

## Requirements:
* You must construct an application powered by at least one generative AI model. Whether it's a text, speech, code, image generation, or another generative AI model or combination of generative AI models, it is up to you.
* Your application can be based on interfacing with the model(s) via API(s), for example, the OpenAI API, or based on installing models locally.
* You must write a short report about your work. You should start writing the report as soon as possible and then update it after you've conducted some hands-on experiments. 
* You have to create and use a GitHub repository for your project. It has to include all the code and documentation needed to understand what you did and how. It must also contain your written report. You will submit a link to this repository to Canvas before the deadline. If the repository is private, you must add me (user alu042) as a collaborator before submitting.
* Your work must be well-documented and, of course, not plagiarized. If you incorporate other people's code or ideas in your solutions, ensure that you fully understand them and include references.
* It must be easy for others to reproduce your work.
* You must create a short video demonstrating how one can interact with your application or, alternatively and even better, make it available by hosting it online.
